# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network
This architecture is a deep convolutional neural network designed for classification tasks. It alternates between convolutional layers with ReLU activations, batch normalization to stabilize training, dropout for regularization, and pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important features. This structure balances depth, normalisation, and regularisation to achieve high accuracy and generalisation on the dataset by using techniques like early stopping and learning rate reduction.
